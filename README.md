A very simple application which writes all sensor data into a .csv by pressing a button. Works with smartphone and smartwatch. Missing sensors are ignored. The .csv is structured as follows:

*Timestamp in milliseconds since start; Sensor ID; Values*

The file is named after the current System.currentTimeMillis () timestamp and is stored under 

*MainStorage/Android/Data/de.tonifetzer.sensorrecorder/files/documents/sensorOutFiles/...*

However, the path may differ from device to device, depending on whether an SD card is included or not. The Sensors have the following ID's:

    - ACCELEROMETER(0),
    - GRAVITY(1),
    - LINEAR_ACCELERATION(2),
    - GYROSCOPE(3),
    - MAGNETIC_FIELD(4),
    - PRESSURE(5),
    - ORIENTATION_NEW(6),
    - ROTATION_MATRIX(7),
    - WIFI(8), (not supported)
